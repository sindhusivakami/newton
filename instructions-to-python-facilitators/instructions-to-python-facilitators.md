# Instructions to Python Facilitators

#### Hello Change-Makers, 

We welcome you aboard to teach **Basics of Python Programming** to over **100k young women** between the age group of 15-25, from various parts of the country. Your contribution is highly valuable in creating a drastic impact in the learning journey of these young women and enabling them to get an **aspirational job**, have **a voice**, and be equipped to **bring at least 10 families out of poverty** in a financially sustainable model.

We're glad you have decided to teach Python Programming to young children. 

To ensure you have a smooth onboarding and enable you to self start this process, sharing a few simple steps you can follow.
